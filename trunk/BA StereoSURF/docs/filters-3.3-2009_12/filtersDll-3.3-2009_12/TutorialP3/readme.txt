You can use the "*.py" directly in "..\Bin"

Or if you use the "Eclipse" IDE and the Python plugin "PyDev", then you can use the ".project" file
  ->you can have a look in "Eclipse \ Properties \ PyDev - PYTHONPATH \ External Source Folders", 
    we have added the path to the python module "FiltersDllPy"
