This is a tutorial in language C, with the free IDE Eclipse
You must first build TutorialC2.exe, and then execute it from the directory ..\Bin (if not, the image files will not be found..)


>>> To install AND configure the Eclipse IDE :
	-> you must have a C/C++ compiler, 
		for example, see at http://www.mingw.org/, 
		download MinGW-5.1.2 from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435
			don't forget to select g++ compiler, the gnu c++ compiler
	-> you must have C/C++ extension : see at http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/ 
		or in Eclipse Menu Help\Software Update\Find and Install\Search for new feature\New Remote site, 
			set Name=CDT URL=http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/callisto
	-> you must have C/C++ extension : see at http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/
	-> open the C/C++ perspective in Eclipse : \Window\Open perspective...\C/C++
	-> import the tutorialC2 project : \File\import...\General\Existing Projects into Workspace
		and set 'Select root directory'='C:\DEV\FiltersTutorial\TutorialC2'
	-> Build the project (right click on 'FiltersTutorialC2', choose 'Build project')
